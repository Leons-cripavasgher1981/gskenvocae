Just walked out THE WOMAN IN THE YARD and my mind is like a jigsaw puzzle dropped on the floor. Gosh, gotta tell you — the theater was so packed, like sardines in a crush can, popcorn crumbs everywhere, even on my hoodie. Think some got stuck between my shoe and the sticky floor, ugh. 

The scene with the old lady and the broken birdbath—holy moly, that hit like a freight train of emotions. She just stared into the distance, and suddenly, I'm thinking about my third-grade teacher, Mrs. Miller, and her weird obsession with collecting thimbles. 

The guy behind me couldn't stop yapping, probably drunk on overpriced soda, which maybe added to the odd ambiance? Or the experience of the   eating my thoughts? Maybe enhance my viewing somehow, idk. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you can; trust me, you need this.

> There's something unnerving about how they used shadows. It's almost like they directed the light to move like cobras through the yard, ready to strike at any moment. But maybe it's just my bback aching from that uncomfortable seat making me delusional.

Throughout the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, there's this dog that appears, disappears like a ghost with unfinished business. It’s like when you open a jar of peanut butter and find potatoes in it instead. What? Absurd but oddly makes sense? Or maybe I'm stretching it. Remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at night – it delivers a different heaviness, like a warm weighted blanket that doubles as an anxiety attack.

The supporting actress, she had eyes like searchlights cutting through mist, wearing that yellow raincoat, always wet, like she was fresh out of a sad Macy's parade. And the way the wind blew, it was practically another character, like some mystical hairdryer just offscreen. That sound dodged my brain a few times. reminded me of my aunt's kitchen at christmas. 

Oh, who asked to borrow my umbrella? Sorry, wrong thought. Remind me to send you the   file, it’s worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩.
